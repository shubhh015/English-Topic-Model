# Making Basic Enlgish Model

A model for Topic Modelling using LDA is made by using the [gensim](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/) library.

# What it can be used for?

This Topic Modelling Model can be used for any English Database.

# Dataset

For the model, Wikipedia dump has been used as the Dataset, which has over 4 million articles in English. The dataset can be found [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2). The dataset size is 16.2 GB.

# Requirements

Written in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/arnav-deep/EnglishTopicModel/blob/master/requirements.txt). Using a virtual environment is recommended.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Preprocessing Dataset and making gensim corpus

The code for tpreprocessing dataset is written in [create_wiki_corpus.py](https://github.com/arnav-deep/EnglishTopicModel/blob/master/create_wiki_corpus.py).<br>
Note: This process will take around 10 hours to complete. Output file is a gensim corpus of size 34.6 GB, so it's not uploaded.

# Training the Model

The code to train the model is written in the script [train_lda_model.py](https://github.com/arnav-deep/EnglishTopicModel/blob/master/train_lda_model.py).<br>
The model has been trained via unsupervised learning on the complete dataset of all Wikipedia English articles. The number of topics trained on the model is 130.<br>
Note: This process will take around 6 hours to complete. The model files have already been saved here in the [Models](https://github.com/arnav-deep/EnglishTopicModel/tree/master/Models) folder.

# Checking the model

The code for checking the topics inside the model can be found in [show_model_topics.py](https://github.com/arnav-deep/EnglishTopicModel/blob/master/show_model_topics.py).<br>
Run the code to see the topics. The topics have a number id. It can be seen that the words in the topics have similaritites among them.<br>
Model can be improved by tweaking the number of topics. This strictly depends on usage.

```python
python load_model.py
```

This will return list of topics the model has made.
